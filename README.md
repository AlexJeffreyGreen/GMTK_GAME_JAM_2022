Welcome to Dice Battler (fantastic and extremely original name). This is a game of rolling attack and defense dice and battling against various unique monsters.

Each monster poses a threat to your survival in the battle arena of the grey void. You must be ready to quickly select as many dice as you need to attack and defend against the oncoming attacks. 


How to play:

Select dice by clicking an unselected dice with the left mouse button to use it as an attack dice.

Select  dice by clicking an unselected dice with the right mouse button to use it as a defense dice.

These values will be added to your attack and defense points and now you are ready for battle!

Basic Example:

Hero:

3 ATK / 3 DEF 

Monster:

4 ATK / 2 DEF

Result:

Player will take 1 damage

Monster will take 1 damage

How to attack and defend:

You can either manually attack by clicking the sword icon on your card OR waiting until the monster auto attacks. Either option works just fine!

You can also defend against an attack and reroll the stats of a monster. This is an option if you can't seem to get the rolls you want. This is also a game mechanic I kind of introduced a bit too late, so it might not be fully fleshed out. Just roll with it.

You cannot heal in the game, I ran out of time to implement any other type of dice (healing dice, magic dice, etc.). So, just play until you die!

Note:

1) The monsters will attack every 15 seconds, so be ready!

2) The dice reroll randomly, the value requirement is built in multiples of 6. So level one's max monster attack and defense can only be 6 points each. It will get much harder as you progress! 54 is a possibility (which is a brutal roll  requirement of all 6's).

3) This is an endless game with no real win condition because I ran out of time. The main concept is here and that makes me feel that sweet sense EA pride and accomplishment.

4) I am aware that the music kind of fades out and then restarts after a few seconds. I made a song with way too much of a gap and haven't fixed it.
